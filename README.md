# 🧠 Git Cheatsheet

A personal Git learning and revision tool, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).  
This is **not** a step-by-step tutorial. Instead, it’s a curated collection of:

- 🛠 Common but essential Git commands  
- 🎯 Interview-style questions (with answers)  
- 📚 Deeper dive articles on how Git works under the hood  
- 🧾 Cheatsheet-style sections for quick review

The goal? Help myself (and maybe you) **upgrade Git skills**, prepare for interviews, and review practical Git knowledge in a clean and minimal format.
